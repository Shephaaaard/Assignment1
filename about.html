    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Uzoma Chinedu Chijioke, Male. Born on the 20th of April 1990, in Lagos State. I am from Imo State, <br> and a graduate of Imo State University, Owerri where I studied Microbiology. I am also a student of Altschool Africa, <br> of the School of Engineering, Frontend Engineering track.
    My hobbies include song writting, watching movies, gaming, <br> travelling and football. I am currently growing a new hobby, and that is coding. I am artistically inclined and I love <br> entertainment as I work towards changing the world of our entertainment industry in Nigeria.

    <h1>Why I Joined AltSchool Africa</h1>
    <p>One day at work, I heard my Line manager speak to our IT support guys and requested that something be changed on the company's <br> app ad website. Within two hours, it was changed.  That was when I started to seek the skill behind that. What happens behind the screen <br> that can cause this effective change? Then I started ask questions and it first landed me on Codecademy's platform, then AltSchool.</p>

    <h1>What I Plan To Achieve With AltSchool</h1>
    <p>Enrolling in Altschool Africa has been a big step towards achieving a foundational but deep knowledge in tech. I have never written a line code <br> before and I hope to come out pure and fashioned for this tech journey. I seek to become a world-class engineer. Although I still stuggle with catching up, <br> I know I will come out perfect.
        With Altschool Africa, I hope to become a well grounded developer, a programmer well recognized and acknowledged in the tech space.
